# Open-Source vs Closed-Source AI Models: A Comparison

## Open-Source AI Models

### **Strengths:**
1. **Transparency & Auditability** - You can inspect the code, architecture, and training processes, making it possible to identify biases, security issues, or unexpected behaviors
2. **Customization & Flexibility** - You can modify, fine-tune, or integrate the models into your own applications without restrictions
3. **Cost-Effective & Accessible** - Usually free to use and distribute, lowering barriers for developers, researchers, and small organizations

### **Weaknesses:**
1. **Resource Limitations** - Often lack the massive computational resources and high-quality datasets that enable state-of-the-art performance
2. **Quality Variability** - Dependent on community contributions, which can lead to inconsistent maintenance and fragmented development
3. **Limited Support & Documentation** - May lack professional support channels, comprehensive documentation, or clear troubleshooting 
```
- Strengths:
  - live discovered model
  - available via API
  - candidate for testing
- Weaknesses:
  - license must be verified
  - availability may change
  - needs benchmark testing
